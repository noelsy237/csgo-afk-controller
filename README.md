# csgo-afk-controller
A script to handle auto gun and bomb drops, as well as auto-kill. 
Auto-accept has also been added.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Place the exe file into your csgo directory. `\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo`
3. Enter this command `con_logfile "console.log"` into either your console each time or into autoexec. (Restart CSGO after running the command)
4. Run the exe and follow the options

## Notes
Both scripts require you to be tabbed into the game.
You should probably delete the console.log file occasionally as it can get to a large size.
